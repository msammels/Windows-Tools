# About the Project
The code within this website has been designed in order to take care of some things that help to cater towards my OCD.

<p width="100%" align="right"><a href="#">üîù</a></p>

## Built With
* [Microsoft Windows](https://microsoft.com/windows)

# Getting Started
There's nothing unusual in here. But please be careful when mucking about with these. <br />
<strong>I can take no liability or responsibility if something goes wrong while you are using these.</strong>

## Prerequisites
Pretty much any Windows. These were created using Windows 10 (the beta version and the final version). Theoretically,
they should work on any Windows operating system which makes use of the Registry Hives in the files, but I have not
yet tested them on such systems.

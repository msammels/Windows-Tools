## Security Policy

I take the security of my software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories
managed through GitHub for both my own personal software, open source from other projects which may be there, as
well as my University assignment and practical source code.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of the repositories in my GitHub, please report it
to me as described below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security issues through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please email them to myself at either michael@sammels.net or, if you do not receive a response there, to
my University email which is msa@cs.stir.ac.uk

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help me better understand the
nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of the source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me determine the severity and nature of your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

I prefer all communications to be in English, although I fully understand that this will not be possible for
everyone. If you cannot communicate in English, please feel to still report in your native language and I shall
translate as best I can.
